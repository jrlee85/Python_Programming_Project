### UoL Python Programming projecting scraping and analysing data on the English Premier League

This project was created as part of my Data Science MSc. The task was to explore a data set related to the English Premier League and perform some statistical analysis and visualisation on the data set.

I chose to look at 11 key metrics to see whether these had a strong impact on a team's success. I obtained the data through a combination of direct downloads and web scraping using the BeautifulSoup library. The analysis was performed primarily with Pandas data frames, and the visualisation used Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium to create interactive maps.
